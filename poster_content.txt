1. Project Info
Mini Project Title: AudioGuard - Smart Sound Detection System for Deaf Individuals
One-line description: A deep learning system that detects and classifies urban sounds in real-time, providing haptic feedback through phone vibrations to alert deaf users of important environmental sounds
Dataset: UrbanSound8K dataset (NYU's Urban Sound Research Project)


2. Dataset Summary
Size: 8,732 urban sound recordings
Structure:
10 original sound categories
7 merged actionable classes
10 cross-validation folds
Data Types:
Audio files (.wav format)
Metadata (categories, timestamps, source info)
Labels (original and merged classes)


3. Basic Statistics
Audio Duration:
Mean: 3.6 seconds
Median: 4.0 seconds
Range: 0.1 - 4.0 seconds
Class Distribution:
Most frequent: "other" (merged category)
Priority sounds: sirens, car horns, gunshots
Background sounds: air conditioner, street music


4. Visualizations

5. Key Findings
Most audio samples are between 3-4 seconds long, providing sufficient context for sound recognition
Dataset is well-balanced across 10 cross-validation folds, ensuring robust model training
Priority sounds (sirens, car horns, gunshots) have consistent duration patterns, making them reliable for detection
Background sounds show more duration variability, which helps in distinguishing them from priority alerts
